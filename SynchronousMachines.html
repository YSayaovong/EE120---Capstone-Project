<h1>Synchronous Sequential Machines - Task C-1</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Yengkong Sayaovong</p>
<p><strong>Semester/Year/Session (A/B):</strong> Spring 2022 A</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2/27/22</p>

<h2>Task C-1: Planning the Synchronous Sequential Machines</h2>
<h3>(5 pts) Interview Stakeholders</h3>
<p><strong>Stakeholder name:</strong> Chay S.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Question:</strong> What features are important to make the wheelchair convenient?</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder Answer:</strong> The wheelchair should be easily able to move left or right.</li>

    <li><strong>Question:</strong> What is the most important to you when looking for a wheelchair?</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder Answer:</strong> The wheelchair should be light since we travel a lot as a family. It would be difficult to bring the wheelchair everywhere if it was heavy since we have four kids to watch out for already.</li>

    <li><strong>Question:</strong> What safety features are important to you when choosing a wheelchair?</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder Answer:</strong> With my daughter being only 3 years old and because of her condition, I think having straps to hold her legs in place would really benefit the wheelchair.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(5 pts) Comment on Value Addition</h3>
<p>This wheelchair will mainly be used for everyday use moving from crowds of people to the next crowd so the design must be easy to use and can get user safely from point A to point B.</p>

<h3>(5 pts) Further Stakeholder Input</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Question:</strong> Where do you prefer the move forward, backward, and stop buttons to be?</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder Answer:</strong> I would like a joystick instead in case my daughter accidentally leans her hands on the buttons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task C-2: Document the Synchronous Sequential Machines</h2>
<h3>Design #1</h3>
<p><strong>(2 pts) Assumptions:</strong> The assumption that was made was that whenever the user was at the farthest right or left, the state would be reset to 0.</p>

<h2>Task C-4: Apply the Criteria to Pick the Best Design</h2>
<h3>(2 pts) Application of Criteria</h3>
<p>I picked the criteria and weight based on what the customer preference was ranked the highest.</p>

<h3>(3 pts) Best Design Explanation</h3>
<p>Design 2 was a better fit for the criteria because it has the least amount of gates to make the wheelchair functional.</p>

<h2>Task C-5: Build and Simulate Winning Design in Digital</h2>
<p>(10 pts) Insert a copy of your chosen Digital Schematic here. Please make sure that you have outputs or tunnels connected to each flip flop so that you can easily monitor your states.</p>

<h2>Task C-6: Record a Video Demonstration of the Winning Design (Optional)</h2>
<p>For every clock cycle, explain the inputs, what current state you are in, and point out any outputs that should be noted.</p>
